If not Tailwind: Choose a consistent styling approach (e.g., CSS Modules, Styled Components, Emotion).

Responsiveness Focus: Application is for desktop web only. Focus on a good desktop experience.

UI Quality: Aim for a clean, professional, and intuitive UI. Refer to Figma designs where available; make reasonable choices for missing states.
